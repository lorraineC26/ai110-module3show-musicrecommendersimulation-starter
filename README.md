# 🎵 Music Recommender Simulation

## Project Summary

In this project you will build and explain a small music recommender system.

Your goal is to:

- Represent songs and a user "taste profile" as data
- Design a scoring rule that turns that data into recommendations
- Evaluate what your system gets right and wrong
- Reflect on how this mirrors real world AI recommenders

Replace this paragraph with your own summary of what your version does.

## How The System Works

### Real-World Context: Two Ways to Recommend

Most recommendation systems use one of two approaches. **Collaborative filtering** ignores the content of songs entirely — it looks at the listening behavior of thousands of other users and asks *"people who liked what you liked also liked this."* This is how Spotify's Discover Weekly works. 

**Content-based filtering** takes the opposite approach: it ignores other users entirely and matches songs to a listener based purely on the attributes of the songs themselves — genre, mood, energy, and so on. In this way, the system is fully explainable and requires no user history data.

---

### Song Features

Each `Song` object stores both descriptive labels and numerical audio attributes:

| Feature | Type | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `genre` | categorical | `"lofi"`, `"rock"`, `"jazz"` |
| `mood` | categorical | `"chill"`, `"intense"`, `"happy"` |
| `energy` | float [0–1] | `0.82` (high energy) |
| `acousticness` | float [0–1] | `0.86` (very acoustic) |
| `valence` | float [0–1] | `0.71` (positive/upbeat feel) |
| `danceability` | float [0–1] | `0.79` (highly danceable) |
| `tempo_bpm` | integer | `118` BPM |

---

### UserProfile Fields

A `UserProfile` captures a listener's taste as four preferences that map directly onto the song features above:

- `favorite_genre` — the genre the user most wants to hear
- `favorite_mood` — the listening mood they are in right now
- `target_energy` — a float [0–1] representing how energetic they want the music to be
- `likes_acoustic` — a boolean indicating whether they prefer acoustic or electronic sound

---

### How a Score Is Computed (per song)

The `Recommender` calls `score_song()` on every song in the catalog. Each song receives a weighted score in [0, 1] built from four components:

```
score = 0.40 × genre_match
      + 0.30 × mood_match
      + 0.20 × (1 - |song.energy - user.target_energy|)
      + 0.10 × (1 - |song.acousticness - user_acousticness_pref|)
```

- `genre_match` and `mood_match` are binary (1 if it matches, 0 if not)
- The energy and acousticness terms use **proximity scoring**: the closer the song's value is to the user's preference, the higher the contribution
- `user_acousticness_pref` is 0.8 if `likes_acoustic` is True, else 0.2

Genre carries the highest weight (0.40) because it is the most decisive user filter. Mood is second (0.30) because it reflects listening intent. Numerical features get lower weights because they award partial credit naturally through proximity — even a near-miss still contributes.

---

### Sample Taste Profile

The recommender uses a `user_prefs` dictionary (or `UserProfile` object) as input. Below is the concrete profile used in this simulation:

```python
SAMPLE_USER_PROFILE = {
    "favorite_genre": "rock",
    "favorite_mood": "energetic",
    "target_energy": 0.75,
    "likes_acoustic": False
}
```

**Why each value was chosen:**

| Field | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `favorite_genre` | `"rock"` | Sets a clear genre anchor — songs that match earn a full 0.40 bonus |
| `favorite_mood` | `"energetic"` | Paired with genre to reward driven, active songs rather than relaxed ones |
| `target_energy` | `0.75` | Moderately high — close enough to rock's typical range (0.85–0.97) to reward it, but not so extreme that only one song qualifies |
| `likes_acoustic` | `False` | Penalizes highly acoustic songs; prefers electric/produced sound (acousticness preference becomes 0.2) |

**Why this profile is not too narrow:**

`target_energy = 0.75` sits between the extremes of the catalog. Songs at 0.60–0.90 all earn a meaningful energy score. A perfectly narrow profile (e.g., `target_energy = 0.97`) would collapse the ranking to a single obvious match; this value keeps the field competitive.

**Worked example — differentiating "intense rock" from "chill lofi":**

Using the formula `score = 0.40×genre + 0.30×mood + 0.20×energy_prox + 0.10×acoustic_prox` and `user_acousticness_pref = 0.2` (because `likes_acoustic = False`):

| Song | genre | mood | energy_prox | acoustic_prox | **Total** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Storm Runner (rock, intense, e=0.91, a=0.10) | 0.40 | 0.00 | 0.20×(1−0.16)=0.168 | 0.10×(1−0.10)=0.090 | **0.658** |
| Midnight Coding (lofi, chill, e=0.42, a=0.71) | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.20×(1−0.33)=0.134 | 0.10×(1−0.51)=0.049 | **0.183** |

The gap (0.658 vs 0.183) shows the profile strongly favors the rock track — genre and mood alone account for most of the difference, while the energy and acousticness terms reinforce it.

### How Songs Are Chosen (ranking)

After scoring every song, `recommend_songs()` sorts the full scored list in descending order and returns the top `k` results (default `k = 5`). The pipeline looks like this:

```
Catalog (20 songs)
      │
      ▼  score_song() × 20
[(song, 0.91), (song, 0.74), (song, 0.43), ...]
      │
      ▼  sort descending, take top k
[song_5, song_10, song_2, ...]   ← recommendations
```

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # Mac or Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

### Running Tests

Run the starter tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

You can add more tests in `tests/test_recommender.py`.

## Experiments You Tried

Use this section to document the experiments you ran. For example:

- What happened when you changed the weight on genre from 2.0 to 0.5
- What happened when you added tempo or valence to the score
- How did your system behave for different types of users

---

## Limitations and Risks

Summarize some limitations of your recommender.

Examples:

- It only works on a tiny catalog
- It does not understand lyrics or language
- It might over favor one genre or mood

You will go deeper on this in your model card.

---

## Reflection

Read and complete `model_card.md`:

[**Model Card**](model_card.md)

Write 1 to 2 paragraphs here about what you learned:

- about how recommenders turn data into predictions
- about where bias or unfairness could show up in systems like this


---

## 7. `model_card_template.md`

Combines reflection and model card framing from the Module 3 guidance. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

```markdown
# 🎧 Model Card - Music Recommender Simulation

## 1. Model Name

Give your recommender a name, for example:

> VibeFinder 1.0

---

## 2. Intended Use

- What is this system trying to do
- Who is it for

Example:

> This model suggests 3 to 5 songs from a small catalog based on a user's preferred genre, mood, and energy level. It is for classroom exploration only, not for real users.

---

## 3. How It Works (Short Explanation)

Describe your scoring logic in plain language.

- What features of each song does it consider
- What information about the user does it use
- How does it turn those into a number

Try to avoid code in this section, treat it like an explanation to a non programmer.

---

## 4. Data

Describe your dataset.

- How many songs are in `data/songs.csv`
- Did you add or remove any songs
- What kinds of genres or moods are represented
- Whose taste does this data mostly reflect

---

## 5. Strengths

Where does your recommender work well

You can think about:
- Situations where the top results "felt right"
- Particular user profiles it served well
- Simplicity or transparency benefits

---

## 6. Limitations and Bias

Where does your recommender struggle

Some prompts:
- Does it ignore some genres or moods
- Does it treat all users as if they have the same taste shape
- Is it biased toward high energy or one genre by default
- How could this be unfair if used in a real product

---

## 7. Evaluation

How did you check your system

Examples:
- You tried multiple user profiles and wrote down whether the results matched your expectations
- You compared your simulation to what a real app like Spotify or YouTube tends to recommend
- You wrote tests for your scoring logic

You do not need a numeric metric, but if you used one, explain what it measures.

---

## 8. Future Work

If you had more time, how would you improve this recommender

Examples:

- Add support for multiple users and "group vibe" recommendations
- Balance diversity of songs instead of always picking the closest match
- Use more features, like tempo ranges or lyric themes

---

## 9. Personal Reflection

A few sentences about what you learned:

- What surprised you about how your system behaved
- How did building this change how you think about real music recommenders
- Where do you think human judgment still matters, even if the model seems "smart"
